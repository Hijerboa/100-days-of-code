# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made basic min max funciton, currently not working due to recursion, I think

**Thoughts**: What ever is this algorithm? I don' know at this point. Min max is so difficult to wrap my head around, I don't even honestly know what to think. I think the recursion in one of my functions is messing with a for loops incrementor. 


### Day 2: January 7th, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Tried to troubleshoot the issues with recursion, which appears to be be stemming from the recursion going too deep, or something along those lines. Not entirely sure.
**Thoughts**: I. Hate. Recursion. But getting things to work is fun too...

### Day 3: January 8th, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Thanks to a user over at FCC, I managed to solve the stack overflow issue. Now instead of getting an error, it just ge the wrong output... Guess that's an improvement.
**Thoughts**: That wonderful feeling when you think something is working the way you intended for it to work, but then you find out it doesn't, so you silently weep. Such fun.
