# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made basic min max funciton, currently not working due to recursion, I think

**Thoughts:** What ever is this algorithm? I don' know at this point. Min max is so difficult to wrap my head around, I don't even honestly know what to think. I think the recursion in one of my functions is messing with a for loops incrementor.
